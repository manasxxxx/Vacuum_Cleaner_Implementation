<big> MODEL BASED AGENTS </big>

A Model Based agent is an agent that uses a model of the world

Current percept is combined with old internal state to generate the updated description of the current state based on the agent’s model of ‘how the world works’
Agent maintains some sort of internal-state that depends on the percept history reflecting at least some of the unobserved aspects of the current state.
