# Model-Based Agents

A Model-Based agent is an agent that uses a model of the world.

Current percept is combined with old internal state to generate the updated description of the current state based on the agent’s model of ‘how the world works’. The agent maintains some sort of internal state that depends on the percept history reflecting at least some of the unobserved aspects of the current state.

Before you take an action, you have to check what action was previously taken and update the internal state with the action taken. The action taken will decide what the next state will be like.
